As a CS â€˜24 graduate, I am excited to join a world exceedingly driven by emerging technologies that are automating and defining our future. 
For the last three years, I have been focusing on learning and working at the intersection of embedded hardware and training data models for mass automation. 
Combined with my ethics as a team player who thrives in a collaborative environment and has a strong combination of technical and interpersonal skills, 
I am seeking opportunities that demand efficiency and pose challenges that are especially appealing since they allow me to test my distinct skill set 
in fast-paced, high-pressure settings. Fostering good teamwork has been an important element of this journey, with collaborative efforts leading to larger 
accomplishments than individual endeavors. I am eager to use my expertise in data analysis, programming, and team leadership to propel important initiatives ahead, 
leveraging a team's total ability to solve tough issues. My experience streamlining processes through technology updates and strategic planning demonstrates 
my commitment to meeting and exceeding efficiency standards.
